 Create a Dashboard based on which User would be able to analyze the sentiment of the specific stock. You’re required to create an Analytical Server "OHLC" (Open/High/Low/Close) time series based on the ‘Stock List’ dataset which will be provided to you in a separate JSON format and its output should be a timely report printed in Charts.
